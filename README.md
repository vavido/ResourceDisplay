# Resource Display (working name)
Just a stupid idea i had to use some 7-Segment displays i had to make a live display for the resource use on my PC.

This repo includes the board layout (in `EAGLE Files`) files, CAD drawings of the case (in `case`), the arduino sketch in `ResourceDisplay` and the Desktop application to go with it in `ArudinoSerial`.
